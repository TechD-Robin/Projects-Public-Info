  <p>I collected a lot of comic books, and sometimes I forget which episode I bought last time when I was shopping in a bookstore, so I developed this app to organize my collections.</p>
  <p>Now, I want to share my work - this ad-free app "Collections Storage - QS" with people in need.</p>
  <p>It helps you to record your collection's information via its barcode, and there are memo, tag and spotlight search features to sort out quickly.</p>
  <p>If you like this app, I would appreciate it if you could buy me a coffee (subscribe or purchase this app) to support my creation and my life, and it would be wonderful to know if this app could help you.</p>
  <p>There is no sponsor feature in the app store, so I released free and complete editions; the free edition contains almost all features and has a few limitations, such as the number of record limits.</p>
  <p>As a freeware, I want users who can freely use this app, so there is a "Daily bonus" feature can extend the number of record limits for free.</p>
  <p>Contact me via email if you have any questions or have a problem.</p>
